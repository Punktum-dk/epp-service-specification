## Introduction

This document describes and specifies the implementation offered by DK Hostmaster for interaction with the central registry for the ccTLD dk using the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP). It is primarily aimed at a technical audience, and the reader is required to have prior knowledge of DNS registration and administration and EPP.

<a id="about-this-document"></a>

### About this Document

This specification describes version 4.X.X of the DK Hostmaster EPP Implementation. Future releases will be reflected in updates to this specification, please see the [Document History](#document-history) section below.

The document describes the current DK Hostmaster EPP implementation, for more general documentation on the EPP protocol, EPP client development or configuration, please refer to the RFCs and additional resources in the [References](#references) and [Resources](#resources) chapters below.

Do note that the specification aims to describes the latest release of the service. Service version is listed in the [Document History](#document-history),
so given changes implemented in the service are reflected in the specification. Do note that a service might be released to the sandbox environment
prior to being released to production after a grace period.

This document is not the authoritative source for business and policy rules and possible discrepancies between this an any authoritative sources are regarded as errors in this document. This document is aimed at being the external technical specification and describes the implementation facing the users and is an interpretation of authoritative sources and can therefor be erroneous.

The actively used XSD file is indicated in the [EPP service specification][DKHMEPPWIKI], the [EPP XSD file repository][DKHMXSD] might contain changes not actively used by the service.

The current service version can be obtained from the [Greeting](#greeting) message, from the service.

Any future extensions and possible additions and changes to the implementation are not within the scope of this document and will not be discussed or mentioned throughout this document.

The specification mentions the **Registrar Portal** service (RP), which complements the EPP service for consistency between services.

## The .dk Registry in Brief

DK Hostmaster is the registry for the ccTLD for Denmark (dk), with DK Hostmaster maintaining the central DNS registry.

The legislation and registry model utilized in Denmark imposes some limitations compared to the general scope of the EPP protocol. These limitations are described in detail below in the chapter entitled Implementation Limitations, and these are explained further in the command descriptions where the single commands deviate from the EPP standard specification. In addition to limitations and deviations in the mentioned sections, a few others have been implemented to support DNS registration under Danish legislation, these are described in detail under the individual commands where relevant.

DK Hostmaster offer two administration models, please see [the complete description of the concept][CONCEPT] of the administration models offered by DK Hostmaster A/S for details.

In brief the two models are:

- Registrar managed, where the registrar takes the administrative role of the domain name and administers the assets with DK Hostmaster "registrar management"
- Registrant managed, where the registrant administers the assets directly with DK Hostmaster, also referred to as: "registrant management"

The EPP service is the same, but the capabilities and business roles vary depending on choice of administrative model. This is described in detail under the different commands and outlined in:

- [Privilege Matrix for Registrant Managed Objects](#privilege-matrix-registrant-managed-objects)
- [Privilege Matrix for Registrar Managed Objects](#privilege-matrix-registrar-managed-objects)

Our EPP extensions are registered with the [IANA EPP Extension Repository][IANA] as by [RFC:7451].

<a id="epp-in-brief"></a>

## EPP in Brief

EPP is an XML-based protocol aimed at provisioning data between registries. The protocol is intended for machine-to-machine communication in a client-server setup. Please see the [References](#references) chapter for more information on specifications and references for EPP.

Please note that the service does not support XML entity expansion on the server side, due to security implications related to this feature.

<a id="epp-service"></a>

## EPP Service

The DK Hostmaster’s EPP Service implementation is regarded as a service offered to external parties requiring provisioning actions towards DK Hostmaster.

The EPP service requires the use of and possible development of EPP client software. This is beyond the scope of this specification as the API and other assets for assisting in this are the primary object of this document.

In addition to the assets, DK Hostmaster aims to assist users and developers of EPP client software with integration towards DK Hostmaster and therefore provide facilities to ease this integration. This is primarily centered around a sandbox environment and related documentation.

The service is implemented under the following principles:

1 Adhere to the standard to the extent possible or use non-intrusive extensions to support the requirements or finally use mandatory extensions to adhere to service requirements
1 Use _in-band_ communication, meaning requests made via EPP will be responded to via EPP unless the end-user have specified differently
1 Use standard error codes to the extent possible, communicating state more clearly and unambiguously

<a id="ssltls-support"></a>

### SSL/TLS Support

The EPP service supports the following protocols for transport security:

- TLSv1.2

<a id="available-environments"></a>

### Available Environments

DK Hostmaster offers the following two environments:

- production
- sandbox

Updates to both environments are announced via the tech-announce mailing list.

Please see the [information page][DKHMMAIL] for details on subscribing etc.

<a id="production"></a>

#### Production

- Please see [EPP service specification Wiki][DKHMEPPWIKI] for up to date information for the production environment accessible at: `epp.dk-hostmaster.dk` on port: `700`

- This environment is the production environment
- info and check requests made to this environment will reflect live production data
- create requests made to this environment will be carried out provided that they comply with business rules and general terms
- Approved domains will be processed for possible activation and propagation into the zone
- Contacts (users) will be created and will be available in other systems like the self-service system etc.
- Hosts (name servers) will be processed for possible activation
- The Change Password operation is available in this environment
- Please note that this operation will change the password and this change will be reflected in other production systems
- This is environment is using [IP Whitelisting](#ip-whitelisting)
- This environment is only available to registrars

<a id="sandbox"></a>

#### Sandbox

- Please see [EPP service specification Wiki][DKHMEPPWIKI] for up to date information for the production environment accessible at : `epp-sandbox.dk-hostmaster.dk` on port: `700`

- This environment is intended for client development towards the DK Hostmaster EPP service
- info and check requests made to this environment will reflect sandbox data. For host objects, some static content synched in by DK Hostmaster, in addition to sandbox data
- create requests made to this environment will be serialized in the sandbox environment, provided that syntax and data are valid
- Domains will be enqueued and are processed for possible activation, responses are reflected in messages available for polling, propagation into a zone file is not supported
- Contacts (users) can be created and will only be available in the sandbox system

- The Change Password operation will only change the password in the sandbox environment
- This environment is available to both registrars and name server administrators

Please note that when you first start to use the EPP sandbox environment, the access credentials are matching your production credentials. If these do not work as expected (e.g. error `2200`). please contact: DK Hostmaster to get the credentials synchronized.

For more information on the consolidated sandbox environment please see [the specification][DKHMSANDBOX].

<a id="implementation-requirements"></a>

## Implementation Requirements

This section outlines the overall requirements in regard to implementing an EPP client to work with the DK Hostmaster EPP service.

<a id="client-transaction-id-cltrid"></a>

### Client Transaction ID (`clTRID`)

In order to ensure transactional integrity and due to the asynchronous nature of some of the EPP commands, we rely on the client transaction id to be unique. This is unique as per client id. The assists in ensuring that a delayed response can be easily identified by simple means.

The `clTRID` is recommended to be unique for all transactions and is required to be unique for the [create domain](#create-domain) command.

<a id="ip-whitelisting"></a>

### IP Whitelisting

Access to the EPP service production environment requires IP whitelisting of IP addresses.

Maintenance of IP addresses is done in the **Registrar Portal** (RP) and requires an active registrar account for access.

Please see the [Registrar Portal Service Specification][DKHMRPSPEC] for details.

<a id="service-users"></a>

### Service Users

Access to the EPP service production environment requires IP whitelisting of IP addresses.

Creation and maintenance of service users has to be done in the **Registrar Portal** (RP) and requires an active registrar account for access.

Please see the [Registrar Portal Service Specification][DKHMRPSPEC] for details.

<a id="registrar-account-settings"></a>

### Registrar Account Settings

The EPP service can not work directly the registrar account, only directly on objects such as:

- domain names
- contacts
- name servers (hosts)

Many of the object related commands are working indirectly with the registrar account for:

- billable operations
- change of relations between objects

The EPP does not have any commands that work on the account level, except for the `balance` command, please see the section: "[Balance and Prepaid Account](#balance-and-prepaid-account)" for details.

[create domain](#create-domain), [create contact](#create-contact) and [create host](#create-host) are reacting to the the setting of the default management model. Settings can be overwritten using extension:

- [`dkhm:management`](#dkhmmanagement)

[create domain](#create-domain) is reacting to the the setting of the default renewal model. Settings can be changed used extension:

- [`dkhm:autoRenew`](#dkhmautorenew)

Specification and setting if registrar account settings are reserved to the **Registrar Portal** (RP) and requires an active registrar account for access.

Please see the [Registrar Portal Service Specification][DKHMRPSPEC] for details.

<a id="implementation-extensions"></a>

## Implementation Extensions

The EPP service implemented by DK Hostmaster holds several extensions, these are documented where appropriate for the specific commands etc. This section serves to give an overview of the extensions as a whole.

The domain confirmation process is handled via via the [create domain](#create-domain) command using this extension.

<a id="dkhmdomainadvisory"></a>

### `dkhm:domainAdvisory`

Any special circumstances in relation to a domain name, can be communicated using this special field. Please see [info domain](#info-domain).

Currently two advisories are communicated:

- `pendingDeletionDate`, indicating that a given domain name is scheduled for deletion
- `offeredOnWaitingList`, indicating that a given domain name has been offered to a designated registrant

Domain names pending deletion are in a 30 day redemption period. This period can be initiated by:

- Automatic expiration, see [`dkhm:autoRenew`](#dkhmautorenew)
- Manual cancellation, for EPP via the [delete domain](#delete-domain) command
- Deletion from suspension due lack of payment

Through out the redemption period it is possible to restore the domain using the [restore domain](#restore-domain).

Domain names offered on waiting list, has to be registered using [create domain](#create-domain) as for regular domain name applications.

<a id="dkhmean"></a>

- `registrar`, indicating registrar management
- `registrant`, indicating registrant management

The extension can be used with the commands:

- [create domain](#create-domain)
- [create contact](#create-contact)

If not specified the default of the registrar account will be used. The default can be set in the registrar portal, see: [Registrar Account Settings](#registrar-account-settings).

To change the management model for an existing domain, please see the [transfer domain](#transfer-domain) command.

<a id="dkhmmobilephone"></a>

<a id="dkhmrisk_assessment"></a>

### `dkhm:risk_assessment`

This extension is used in the poll response in relation to domain creation. The extension provides information on the risk assessment made by DK Hostmaster.

Please see the [create domain](#create-domain) command.

<a id="dkhmsecondaryemail"></a>

### `dkhm:secondaryEmail`

Contact objects can have a secondary email address in addition to `email`.

<a id="dkhmtrackingno"></a>

### `dkhm:trackingNo`

A unique tracking number for a domain registration for uniformity with RP. EPP it not the only channel of domain registration and in order to handle registrations via multiple channels, a unique tracking-id is assigned to every request.

<a id="dkhmusertype"></a>

### `dkhm:userType`

The `userType` extension is used to categorize a contact type, since the requirements for data differs between the different user types, we need to be able to differentiate between:

- company
- individual
- public organization
- association

More information is available under the [create contact](#create-contact) command.

Related extensions are [`dkhm:EAN`](#dkhmean), [`dkhm:CVR`](#dkhmcvr) and [`dkhm:pnumber`](#dkhmpnumber).

<a id="implementation-limitations"></a>

## Implementation Limitations

As mentioned the DK Hostmaster EPP service implementation comes with some limitations. Please see the [Compatibility Matrix](compatibility-matrix) in the appendices for a high-level overview.

In general the service is not localized and all EPP related errors and messages are provided in English.

<a id="authentication"></a>

### Authentication

The DK Hostmaster EPP service, only support username/password authentication.

See also the [login](#login) command for details and the section on [Service Users](#service-users).

<a id="authinfo"></a>

### AuthInfo

`AuthInfo` in limited to providing authorizations for 3rd. parties.

It is currently supported for the following commands:

- [update domain](#update-domain), for use for changing name servers
- [transfer domain](#transfer-domain), for use for changing registrar
- [create domain](#create-domain), for use for registering a domain name offered from a waiting list

Please see the individual command descriptions for more details.

For registration of domain names offered from a waiting list, the `AuthInfo` field is utilized for the [create domain](#create-domain), the format of the token is however in this context is simpler.

Specifying `AuthInfo` for a [contact create](#contact-create) has no effect and it is not recommended to disclose this information in this command.

From [RFC:5733]:

> A <contact:authInfo> element that contains authorization
> information to be associated with the contact object.  This
> mapping includes a password-based authentication mechanism, but
> the schema allows new mechanisms to be defined in new schemas.

The element is not optional, but mandatory, it should **not** be populated with sensitive information.

<a id="contact-creation"></a>

### Contact Creation

This command does not support the feature of providing a predefined contact-id. The contact-id has to be specified as `auto` and the contact-id is assigned by DK Hostmaster. See also information on the [create contact](#create-contact) command.

Due to a limitation in the AAA system implemented by DK Hostmaster, it is currently not possible to see contact objects using [info contact](#info-contact), if these are not registrants. This is regarded as a temporarily limitation, which will be addressed at some point in the future. The recommendation is to use [check contact](#check-contact).

REF: [issue #34](https://github.com/DK-Hostmaster/epp-service-specification/issues/34)

<a id="contact-info"></a>

### Contact Info

The command [info contact](#info-contact) will only supply the registrant information. For other contact objects, only if the requesting user and authenticated has a relationship to the designated contact object, either via a host or domain role or registrar group.

<a id="contact-update"></a>

### Contact Update

This command does not support the setting and removal of status using the XML element: `contact:status`. The status is assigned by DK Hostmaster. See also information on the [update contact](#update-contact) command and the appendix with [Contact Status Codes](#contact-status-codes).

<a id="disclosure-of-client-id"></a>

### Disclosure of Client ID

As specified in [RFC:5731], [RFC:5732] and [RFC:5733] the info commands all display a reference sponsoring entity.

The same scheme will be implemented in the Registrar Portal (SB) and the end-user self-service portal (SB) the data presentation is consistent across all portals.

The public facing interface is expected to present the registrar relation as well. Meaning that the information on registrar relation will be made available in:

- in WHOIS, see [DK Hostmaster WHOIS Service Specification][DKHMWHOISSPEC]
- on www.dk-hostmaster.dk, see - [DK Hostmaster RESTful WHOIS Service Specification][DKHMWHOISRESTSPEC]

The following commands for more details:

- [info contact](#info_contact)
- [info domain](#info_domain)
- [info host](#info_host)

<a id="dnssec"></a>

### DNSSEC

I accordance with [RFC:5910]. We support DS only and not DNSKEY. In addition the maximum signature lifetime (`secDNS:maxSigLife`) is disregarded. See [section 3.3][RFC:5910-3.3]) in the referenced RFC.

Not all algorithms are supported, please refer to the [DK Hostmaster Name Service specification][DKHMDNSSPEC] for a complete list of supported algorithms.

Change of name servers using [update domain](#update-domain), removes all current DSRECORDS as part of the operation.

<a id="domain-info"></a>

### Domain Info

The command [info domain](#info-domain) will only supply the registrant information for relevant contact objects. For other contact objects assigned to the domain name, the requesting user has to have a relationship to the domain or contact object, either via a host or domain role or registrar group.

Availability of DNSSEC information and status is currently limited to public available data.

<a id="domain-transfer"></a>

### Domain Transfer

In [RFC:5731 section 3.2.4][RFC:5731-3.2.4] is it described that an optional period can be specified. DK Hostmaster does not support the extension of a period via a transfer.

<a id="domain-update"></a>

### Domain Update

This command does not support the setting and removal of status using the XML element: `domain:status`. The status is assigned by DK Hostmaster. See also information on the [update domain](#update-domain) command and the appendix with [Domain Status Codes](#domain-status-codes).

<a id="encoding-and-idn-domains"></a>

### Encoding and IDN domains

DK Hostmaster supports IDN domain names and the EPP commands support Punycode notation for this in requests. DK Hostmaster does not support Punycode notation in responses at this time.

For details on supported characters, please see: [the DK Hostmaster Name Service specification][DKHMDNSSPEC].

<a id="host-info"></a>

### Host Info

The command [info host](#info-host) will only supply the name server administrator/zone contact information if the requesting and authenticated user has a relationship to the user, either via a domain role or registrar group, which provides authorization to access the information.

<a id="host-update"></a>

### Host Update

This command does not support the setting and removal of status using the XML element: `host:status`. The status is assigned by DK Hostmaster. See also information on the [update host](#update-host) command and the appendix with [Host Status Codes](#domain-status-codes).

<a id="information-disclosure"></a>

### Information Disclosure

Please note that some information is not disclosed when using Object Query Commands. See the specific commands for more information.

Additionally DK Hostmaster does not implement the optional `contact:disclose` element.

> An OPTIONAL <contact:disclose> element that allows a client to
> identify elements that require exceptional server-operator
> handling to allow or restrict disclosure to third parties.  See
> Section 2.9 for a description of the child elements contained
> within the <contact:disclose> element.

From [RFC:5733].

<a id="unimplemented-commands"></a>

### Unimplemented Commands

<a id="unimplemented-command-delete-contact"></a>

#### Unimplemented Command: Delete Contact

The `delete contact` command is not implemented by DK Hostmaster, unlinked contacts are automatically deleted by DK Hostmaster.

<a id="unimplemented-command-transfer-contact"></a>

#### Unimplemented Command: Transfer Contact

The `transfer contact` command is not implemented by DK Hostmaster, Contacts are transferred with their domain name, please see the [transfer domain](#transfer-domain) command.

<a id="unsupported-contact-status-codes"></a>

### Unsupported Contact Status Codes

Several of the host status codes described in [RFC:5733] are not supported.

All of the `client*` status codes are note supported:

- `clientDeleteProhibited`
- `clientUpdateProhibited`
- `clientTransferProhibited`

Since the administrative model does not support user enforced restraints.

- `pendingCreate`
- `pendingDelete`
- `pendingTransfer`

The operation to create a contact is instantaneous.

The listed pending-states for [delete contact](#unimplemented-command-delete-contact) and [transfer contact](#unimplemented-command-transfer-contact) are not supported in the DK Hostmaster registry system.

<a id="unsupported-domain-status-codes"></a>

### Unsupported Domain Status Codes

Several of the domain status codes described in [RFC:5731] and the [ICANN status code description][ICANN] are not supported.

All of the `client*` status codes are not supported:

- `clientDeleteProhibited`
- `clientHold`
- `clientRenewProhibited`
- `clientTransferProhibited`
- `clientUpdateProhibited`

Since the administrative model does not support user enforced restraints.

- `addPeriod`
- `autoRenewPeriod`
- `renewPeriod`
- `transferPeriod`

Are all ICANN statuses and are not regarded as standard and they do not map to business rules used in the DK Hostmaster registry system, based on the descriptions in the [ICANN status code description][ICANN].

- `pendingRenew`
- `pendingRestore`
- `pendingTransfer`

The operations for [renew domain](#renew-domain), [restore domain](#restore-domain) and [transfer domain](#transfer-domain) are instantaneous and the listed pending-states do therefor not map to business processes used in the DK Hostmaster registry system.

- `inactive`

This state is unsupported, since domain names in the DK Hostmaster registry **must** have associated name servers, please see the [Name Service Specification][DKHMDNSSPEC].

The [domain status codes listing](#domain-status-codes) holds a complete listing of all the status codes.

<a id="unsupported-host-status-codes"></a>

### Unsupported Host Status Codes

Several of the host status codes described in [RFC:5732] are not supported.

All of the `client*` status codes are note supported:

- `clientDeleteProhibited`
- `clientUpdateProhibited`

The administrative model does not support user enforced restraints.

- `pendingTransfer`

The transfers for of hosts are a part of the [domain transfer](#domain-transfer) operation, which is instantaneous and as outlined in [RFC:5732] transfer of host objects is does not really apply.

From [RFC:5732]:

> Transfer semantics do not directly apply to host objects, so there is
> no mapping defined for the EPP <transfer> command.  Host objects are
> subordinate to an existing superordinate domain object and, as such,
> they are subject to transfer when a domain object is transferred.

<a id="waiting-list"></a>

## Waiting List

DK Hostmaster offers a waiting list service for domain names, when a domain name becomes available to the first position on a waiting list, it should be registered using the standard registration process either via the Registrar Portal or EPP.

This utilized the [create domain](#create-domain) command, which should either be populated with the token issued by DK Hostmaster authorizing registration. Alternatively the user-id of the waiting list user which has been pre-approved for registration of the domain name with DK Hostmaster.

The state that a domain name is offered to a waiting list can be inspected via the [info domain](#info-domain) via the [`dkhm:domainAdvisory`](#dkhmdomainadvisory) extension.

No other information is available on waiting lists via EPP at this time.

Please refer to the DK Hostmaster [website][DKHMWAITLIST] for more information.

<a id="supported-object-transform-and-query-commands"></a>

## Supported Object Transform and Query Commands

The following section describes the supported EPP commands. As mentioned previously, some of the commands have been extended beyond the basic capabilities of EPP. These extensions are described separately under each command and are included in the [DKHMXSD][DKHMXSD] listed in the [Resources](#resources) chapter. An alphabetical list is also available in the [Implementation Extensions](#implementation-extensions) section.

The supported commands are:

- `hello`
- `login`, including change password
- `logout`
- `create` (contact/domain/host)
- `check` (contact/domain/host)
- `info` (contact/domain/host)
- `update` (contact/domain/host)
- `renew` (domain)
- `transfer` (domain)
- `delete` (host/domain)
- `poll`, including acknowledgement of messages
- `balance` command extension
- `restore` extension to update domain command

Commands that have not been extended are not described in much detail, please refer to the general EPP documentation from IETF via the RFCs listed in [References](#references).

<a id="hello-and-greeting"></a>

### hello and greeting

This part of the EPP protocol is described in [RFC:5730]. This command adheres to the standard. For a more detailed explanation of the data collection policy announced via the greeting, please see the [Data Collection Policy](#data-collection-policy) section.

As announced in the [greeting](#greeting), the following objects are available:

- `Host`, see also the section on [Host assets](#host)
- `Domain`, see also the section on [Domain assets](#domain)
- `Contact`, see also the section on [Contact assets](#contact)

With regard to extensions, the following are available:

- [secDNS-1.1][DKHMXSD]
- [dkhm-4.3][DKHMXSD]

Please see the greeting response included in the [appendices](#greeting) for illustration of the actual announcement.

<a id="login"></a>

### login

This part of the EPP protocol is described in [RFC:5730]. This command adheres to the standard.

The login uses the general Authentication Authorization and Access (AAA) framework in DK Hostmaster. This mean that in addition to the validation of username and password specified as part of the [login request](#login_request), an attempt is made to authorize the authenticated user for access to the actual EPP service and subsequent operations.

[Service Users](#service-users) is an alternative to using regular WHOIS handles. They are reserved to a specific service, like for example EPP and can only be created by the administrator of a registrar group.

DK Hostmaster supports the change of passwords via EPP. Please refer to the chapter Available Environments for any special circumstances.

Password should adhere to the following requirements:

EPP supports a password with at least 6 and a maximum 16 characters, where DK Hostmaster supports 8 - 64 characters. The password must include at least three of these four character types:

- Lower-case letters
- Upper-case letters
- Numbers
- Special Characters

The following characters are legal special characters in passwords:

```text
% ` ' ( ) * + - , . / : ; < > = ! _ & ~ { } | ^ ? $ # @ " [ ]
```

Successful authentication established a session with a life span of 700 seconds (5 minutes), it can be kept alive by sending additional `hello` commands or similar.

The overall life span is 28800 seconds (8 hours) after this the session is terminated and should be reestablished with a new authentication (`login`).

A connection can be prematurely terminated if the service gets in a unstable state.

### Balance and Prepaid Account

With the introduction of administrative model registrar management, a prepaid model for registrars is exchanging the previous invoice driven process and interaction.

This mean that EPP commands relating to billable operations are evaluated in context of the registrar account and accounting is completed as part of the execution of the operation.

The operations currently classified as billable are:

- Domain name application/creation, this is described in detail in the [create domain](#create-domain) section
- Domain name renewal. this is described in detail in the [renew domain](#renew-domain) section
- Restoration from deletion (cancellation), this is described in detail in the [restore domain](#restore-domain) section
- Restoration from suspension due to automatic expiration, also described in detail in the [restore domain](#restore-domain) section

This mean that a new error scenario is introduced with version 4.0.0 of the service for creation/application, where an application/create request will be declined, in case of insufficient funds. The manual renewal operation via [renew domain](#renew-domain) and the option of [automatic renewal](#dkhmautorenew) is not subjected to this policy, please refer to the registrar contract for specific details as this is a technical document and not the authoritative source for business and policy rules.

All prices and amounts relating to currencies are provided in DKK, converted to the EPP currency type, using decimal point (`.`) and not decimal comma (`,`), which is the definition for the Danish locale.

The balance command implementation is based on the extension developed by Verisign, please see: [Verisign: "Balance Mapping for the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)"][BALANCE],  see also [References](#references)

<a id="domain"></a>

### Domain

The default behavior of the EPP [create domain](#create-domain) command as described in [RFC:5731], will attach the client-ID (`CLID`) of the authenticated party to the object created.

Having the client-ID specified at this time indicates that the domain name is under registrar management from creation. To change the registrar and discontinue the registrar management will require a transfer.

For more information on the [disclose of the Client ID](#disclosure-of-client-id)

If the registrar does not want to create domains under registrar management the default behaviour can be configured in RP, where the available are:

- `registrar management`
- `registrant management`

The setting will be global and will influence the behaviour in both:

- EPP
- RP

These [Registrar Account Settings](#registrar-account-settings) are controlling the account as a whole for all relevant commands.

- `create domain`, this section
- [create contact](#create-contact)
- [create host](#create-host)

<a id="create-domain"></a>

#### create domain

This part of the EPP protocol is described in [RFC:5730]. This command adheres to the standard. DK Hostmaster, however, is based on an asynchronous domain creation workflow.

All domain requests are enqueued for further processing and their creation will be in a state of pending (`1001`).

Please note:

- `authInfo` section is not used for transport of end-user passwords, see also section in : [Implementation Limitations](#implementation-limitations) on [authinfo](#authinfo)

Domains offered from a waiting list can be registered using the `create domain` command. It requires the authorization token issued by DK Hostmaster to the designated registrant. The token has to be transported via the `AuthInfo` field.

The `AuthInfo` token used for registration of domain names offered from a waiting list are a 8 digit hexadecimal case insensitive string. The token is offered to the designated registrant out of band and is valid for 14 days.

As described in the section on [waiting lists]("waiting-list) the token is not necessary if the designated registrant for the application use the user-id of the waiting list customer and designated registrant.

A well-formed request for domain creation will always result in:

```text
1001, “Command completed successfully; action pending”
```

The extension in response will provide a unique tracking number, in EPP the `svTRID`, which can be used to identify the creation request across provisioning channels offered by DK Hostmaster. The result of the further processing will be relayed back via EPP, see [Poll and Messages](#poll-and-messages) below.

The customized response for a domain creation request looks as follows:

```xml

        </trID>
    </response>
</epp>
```

The [create domain](#create-domain) command has been extended with a field (`orderconfirmationToken`) making it possible to assign a token indicating that the registrant has agreed to the terms and conditions for DK Hostmaster with the registrar.

```xml
<extension>
	<dkhm:orderconfirmationToken xmlns:dkhm=“urn:dkhm:params:xml:ns:dkhm-4.3”>
		1522744544
	</dkhm:orderconfirmationToken>
</extension>
```

The token is a timestamp in [EPOCH] format, indicating when the agreement was accepted. The [EPOCH] timestamp has to be specify adhering to the POSIX/UNIX standard and has to be specified in seconds. We do not support milliseconds or nanoseconds.

The EPOCH timestamp must not exceed 24 hours into the future compared to local time resolution. In case this exception occurs error code `2004` and a descriptive message.

The `token` is handled the following way:

- If absent DK Hostmaster will require the agreement for the terms and conditions be accepted with DK Hostmaster, this process is handled by DK Hostmaster

- If present. The token will be validated by DK Hostmaster
- if not valid the request with result in an error and the request will be dismissed
- if valid the request will be accepted and processed

The requirement for the registrant to be valid is communicated via the response, using the extension: `dkhm:registrant_validated`.

Please see the command [info contact](#info-contact) for more information.

The state is communicated in this response in order to provide information on the further flow and process of the [create domain](#create-domain) request.

An additional URL is specified in the response via the extension `dkhm:url`, this URL can be presented to the end-user for further processing and for the following scenarios in particular:

1. End-user has not agreed to the terms and conditions
2. End-user has agreed to the terms and conditions, but ID-control is required
3. End-user has agreed to the terms and conditions and ID-control has been completed - no further actions are necessary, self-service access is available and active

As part of the process the final response to a [create domain](#create-domain) is communicated via the message queue. In this response the DK Hostmaster A/S risk assessment is included, it can hold one of the following values:

- `RED` - the registrant is requested to complete successful ID-control before the domain name can become active
- `YELLOW` - the registrant is requested to complete successful ID-control, the domain name becomes active immediately. If ID-control is not completed within the communicated timeframe the domain is made inactive
- `BLUE` - the registrant is requested to complete successful ID-control before the domain name can become active
- `GREEN` - the domain name becomes active immediately
- `N/A` - the risk assessment could not be performed, the registrant is requested to complete successful ID-control before the domain name can become active

The procedures for ID-control are [described on the DK Hostmaster DK website][DKHMIDENT].

Upon approval of the application, meaning the pending operation is processed, the domain name will still reflect: `pendingCreate`. The `pendingCreate` is not removed until the back-end system serving the EPP service indicates that the operation is completed. The domain name can however be active and it is published to the zone, but some operations are prohibited until finalization of the provisioning towards all systems is completed.

The status codes applying to domain are described in the addendum: [Domain Status Codes](#domain-status-codes).

<a id="domain_application_failure"></a>

##### Domain name Application/Creation Failure

As described in the introduction, the existing commands, which are categorized as billable are not changed. Due to the change to the billing procedure however, the application/create operation is extended with a error scenario, for when the prepaid account does not have sufficient funds.

The proposed error message is the following, quoted from [RFC:5730].

> 2104    "Billing failure"
>
> This response code MUST be returned when a server attempts
> to execute a billable operation and the command cannot be
> completed due to a client-billing failure.

The choice of administration model is based on the default set for the registrar account. This can be set in the registrar portal. It can be overwritten per application using the `dkhm:management` extension, which can have one of two values:

- `registrar`, indicating registrar management
- `registrant`, indicating registrant management

The designated registrant (contact) has to be under the same management model or the application will be rejected.

The creation of contacts (registrants) is covered under [create contact](#create-contact).

See diagram: [:eye_speech_bubble:][epp_create_domain]

| Return Code | Description                                                      |

This tracking number (`trackingNo`), listed as an extension and does not replace or interfere with the normal use of the EPP transaction keys, `clTRID` and `svTRID`, but are EPP specific, whereas the tracking number is considered global in DK Hostmaster. The tracking number is also appended to the `svTRID` in addition to the listing in the extension part. Please see the last digits following the last dash.

```XML
<svTRID>9917BE58-3D53-11E2-A5BD-C532BF0DC46A-1234</svTRID>
```

An important note is that the `clTRID` is mandatory for this command. Since we use the `clTRID` to report back via the message polling functionality, when the domain creation request changes state. See the [Client Transaction ID \(`clTRID`\)](#client-transaction-id-cltrid) section under [Implementation Requirements](#implementation-requirements).

The default value for domain value, if not specified, is one year.

<a id="poll-and-messages"></a>

##### Poll and Messages

As described above the creation of domain names is not synchronous, after the  creation of a domain
request, resulting in a pending state, will have to be probed using the poll command.

The outcome can be one of two, please see the examples below:

```

In general this part of the EPP protocol is described in [RFC:5731] and this command adheres to the standard.

The available values for the `reason` field are:

- `In use` for domain names registered with the DK Hostmaster registry
- `Enqueued` for domain names awaiting domain name application processing, This can last a few seconds to a few days if the application require accept of terms and conditions from the designated registrant
- `Offered for pos. on waiting list`, for when the domain name has been offered to a designated registrant from a waiting list position

An example for a waiting list position offering would look as follows:

<a id="info-domain"></a>

#### info domain

This part of the EPP protocol is described in [RFC:5731]. This command adheres to the standard. In addition the command has been extended with two of the DK Hostmaster extensions:

- `dkhm:domainAdvisory`
- `dkhm:registrant_validated`
- `dkhm:authInfoExDate`

Do note that the response only contains the registrant contact object, if the authenticated user has a relationship via the domain name, which provides access to more information.

The below example could shows the public available information. It could be extended with the following data:

```xml
<domain:contact type="admin">DKHM1-DK</domain:contact>
```

and additionally:

```xml
<domain:contact type="billing">DKHM1-DK</domain:contact>
```

Do note that the billing contact and proxy is displayed if the authenticated user has user has authorization to see this information. The registrant role information for the domain is public available. The authorization requires a relationship via a role on the domain name or a registrar group association

For DNSSEC data the availability is limited to only displaying if the information is public available.

The `domain:clID` field communicates portfolio information about the given domain:

- For registrant managed domain names: `<domain:clID>DKHM1-DK<domain:clID>`, indicating DK Hostmaster A/S
- For registrar managed domain names:
    - `<domain:clID>REG-123456</domain:clID>`, as seen by users associated with the registrar account
    - `<domain:clID>Example Registry Name</domain:clID>`, as seen by users not associated with the registrar account

Please see the [addendum on domain status codes](#domain-status-codes).

<a id="info-domain-response-with-domain-advisory"></a>

##### info domain response with domain advisory

A info domain response can be annotated with information using the extension  [`dkhm:domainAdvisory`](#dkhmdomainadvisory).

The advisory can currently communicate two advisories:

- `pendingDeletionDate`, indicating that a given domain name is scheduled for deletion
- `offeredOnWaitingList`, indicating that a given domain name has been offered to a designated registrant

If a domain name is marked for pending deletion, this special status is communicated via the [`dkhm:domainAdvisory`](#dkhmdomainadvisory) extension.

```xml
<extension>
    <dkhm:domainAdvisory advisory="pendingDeletionDate" date="2020-10-14T00:00:00.0Z" domain="eksempel.dk" xmlns:dkhm="urn:dkhm:params:xml:ns:dkhm-4.3"/>
</extension>
```

The field `advisory` indicates a pending delete date with the string: `pendingDeletionDate` followed by a field containing the actual date.

Do note the date is only guiding, since the actual operation of deletion is handled by an external process and operational circumstances might vary and are executed under the discretion of the registry.

If a domain name is offered to a position on a waiting list, the advisory `offeredOnWaitingList` is used.

```xml
<extension>
    <dkhm:domainAdvisory advisory="offeredOnWaitingList" domain="eksempel.dk" xmlns:dkhm="urn:dkhm:params:xml:ns:dkhm-4.3"/>
</extension>
```

Do note that the waiting list status is also used in the [check domain](#check-domain) command, using the `reason` field.

Since a waiting list offering is not a complete domain name registration the data in the response is limited compared to a registered domain name..

<a id="renew-domain"></a>

#### renew domain

This part of the EPP protocol is described in [RFC:5731]. This command adheres to the standard.

Domain name subscriptions can be renewed manually via the EPP service. The feature applies to both:

- Registrant managed domain names, where the registrar is appointed as the billing contact
- Registrar managed domain names

Manual renewal can be done up to the expiration date of the specific domain name. It does not influence automatic renewal or automatic expiration apart from delaying there effective execution and automatic change to the domain name lifespan, please see the below matrices outlining the different scenarios for manual renewal.

| Registrar Management | Billing contact is registrar | Billing contact is non-registrar |
|----------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Automatic renewal    | < expiration date            | N/A                              |
| Automatic expiration | < expiration date            | N/A                              |

:bookmark_tabs: *1 When an invoice is generated for a registrant managed domain name where the billing contact is a non-registrar, the domain names with expiration in a given calendar month are collected on a single invoice for the month as a whole. This mean that a given domain name can be marked for collection between 45 to 75 days prior to expiration. The 45 days are due to the constraints involving requirements for automatic payment via **Betalings Service** (BS) and since a domain name can have expiration by the end of the month, the length of the month has to be taken into account, extending the period with 30 days, giving a total of 75 days.

Do note the constraints on when you can change the billing contact, since might limit window of opportunity for manual renewal and being the billing contact for the domain is a explicit requirement.

See current prices at the DK Hostmaster website: [Products and Prices][DKHMPRICES]. Insufficient funds in the registrar account will not prohibit this operation.

Do note that for period specification, only the unit `y` indicating year is accepted.

The following values for the period specification are accepted:

- `1`
- `2`
- `3`
- `4`
- `5`
- `6`
- `7`
- `8`
- `9`
- `10`

Not specifying acceptable parameters will result in error code `2005` with a message indicating the error.

Not specifying the period parameters will result in the unit: `y` and the value: `1`.

The status code `serverRenewProhibited` is set:

- If the status `pendingCreate` is set, see [domain create](#domain-create)
- If the status `pendingDelete` is set
- If the registrant has not accepted the Terms and Conditions of DK Hostmaster
- If the domain name period renewal will exceed the maximum period of 10 years and 3 months
- If the domain name is not settled/paid
- If the domain name is suspended due to automatic expiration
- If the domain name is on hold or blocked, meaning it has been suspended by DK Hostmaster

#### update domain

This part of the EPP protocol is described in [RFC:5731]. This command does not adhere to the standard

- `authInfo` is used to handle AuthInfo tokens and cannot be used for and is **not** recommended for transport of end-user passwords
- `contact` object in the  `ns` section is ignored

This command covers a lot of functionality, it can complete operations such as:

- change registrant for domain
- add name server to domain
- remove name server from domain
- add admin contact
- remove admin contact
- add billing contact
- remove billing contact
- remove DSRECORDS
- add DSRECORDS
- set/generate AuthInfo token
- unset/clear AuthInfo token

In addition it supports DNSSEC management capabilities as specified in [RFC:5910].

The command will be evaluated as an atomic command, even though it is dispatched to several sub-commands.

Diagram of EPP process for EPP update domain [:eye_speech_bubble:][epp-update-domain]

The requirements for the command to commence with processing it that the following data are available:

- a valid domain name
- a sub-command, consisting of either
	- add (`add`)
	- change (`chg`)
	- remove (`rem`)

If the request is not valid the service responds with a `2005`.

If the command is valid, the command is separated into one of more of the following sub-commands (by order of precedence):

1. change registrant
1. remove name server
1. remove admin contact
1. remove billing contact
1. add name server
1. add admin contact
1. add billing contact

1. remove DSRECORDS
1. add DSRECORDS

1. setting authinfo
1. unsetting authinfo

The commands are then executed sequentially (order is dictates the precedence) as a single transaction. If a single sub-command fails, the transaction is rolled-back and the relevant error code is returned (`2XXX`).

The command might be stopped if the sub-commands cannot be executed. For example if one of the sub-commands is a: change registrant, none of the other commands can be executed, since role changes will be implicit.

Do note that the change of billing contact, if inserting a registrar-user, will be _silent_, meaning no e-mails will be sent to the registrant or existing billing contact or other contacts.

When the command succeeds either `1000` or `1001` is returned the latter if one of the operations initiated by the sub-command require additional actions to be taken, `1001` will have precedence over `1000`. If a `1001` is returned the status code `pendingUpdate` might be set if an additional **update domain** command is issued.

Please see the below sections for details on the different sub-commands.

The command might be blocked and the status code: `serverUpdateProhibited` is returned indicating that an update is not possible. The status code `clientUpdateProhibited` will be returned if the issued update request cannot be fulfilled due to a domain lock with the registry. See also [ICANN description][ICANN] of status codes.

<a id="change-registrant"></a>

##### change registrant

The change of registrant operation results in all privileges and rights being transferred to another entity. A registrar only holds the privileges to complete such an operation for domains in own portfolio.

This mean the following prerequisites have to be met:

- The domain name has to be in the portfolio of the registrar requesting the change

- The registrant on the domain name has to be in the portfolio of the registrar requesting the change

- The domain name has to be in a state where it can have the registrant changed

- The contact designated to be appointed as the new registrant are in the portfolio of the registrar requesting the change

- The contact designated to be appointed as the new registrant has to be in a state where it can be assigned the role of registrant

The command can be issued in two variations:

1. With the use of the `dkhm:orderconfirmationToken`, where the designated registrant has approved Terms and Condition for DK Hostmaster with the registrar.

1. As standard without any use of extensions

The two above methods reflect the same usage as for domain name application using [domain create](#domain-create).

Here follows an example of a request to change the registrant using the seconds method.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
    <command>
        <update>
            <domain:update xmlns:domain="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:domain-1.0">
                <domain:name>eksempel.dk</domain:name>
                <domain:chg>
                    <domain:registrant>DKHM1-DK</domain:registrant>
                </domain:chg>
            </domain:update>
        </update>
        <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
    </command>
</epp>
```

The response indicates that the operation has one or more pending actions

1. DK Hostmaster require that the designated registrant accepts terms and conditions

1. DK Hostmaster require that ID-control is successfully completed

If the registrant already has completed ID-control, the second action will not be required.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
    <response>
        <result code="1001">
	        <msg>Command completed successfully; action pending</msg>
        </result>
        <trID>
            <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
            <svTRID>54321-XYZ</svTRID>
        </trID>
    </response>
</epp>
```

To assist the registrant the registrar can offer collect the accept of terms and conditions for DK Hostmaster and indicate the accept of these via the extension: `dkhm:orderconfirmationToken`.

Then the request would have to be extended with the use of the mentioned extension:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
    <command>
        <update>
            <domain:update xmlns:domain="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:domain-1.0">
                <domain:name>eksempel.dk</domain:name>
                <domain:chg>
                    <domain:registrant>DKHM1-DK</domain:registrant>
                </domain:chg>
            </domain:update>
        </update>
		<extension>
			<dkhm:orderconfirmationToken xmlns:dkhm=“urn:dkhm:params:xml:ns:dkhm-4.3”>
				1522744544
			</dkhm:orderconfirmationToken>
		</extension>
        <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
    </command>
</epp>
```

The below example of a response, when the accept of terms and conditions has been collected and ID-control has been completed beforehand.

<a id="add-name-server"></a>

##### add name server

The addition of a new name server to a domain name or a re-delegation requires that the new name server must offer resolution for the domain name in question.

Note as of version of 4.X.X the commands to change name servers (addition and removal) require AuthInfo token. The AuthInfo token is either provided out of band or can be obtained using the `info domain` command. It can also be generated using the `update domain` command, please see the section on setting AuthInfo.

With this process change, the change of name servers operation using [update domain](#update-domain), also delete all DSRECORDS.

##### remove name server

The removal of a existing name server from a domain name requires that at least two other name servers are offering resolution for the domain in question, else the command will fail.

Since the update domain command can contain several sub-commands, this could be accompanied by an *add name server* (see above), so the policy requirement is met and resolution is kept.

As noted under "add name server", since version of 4.X.X the commands to change name servers (addition) require AuthInfo token. The AuthInfo token is either provided out of band or can be obtained using the `info domain` command. It can also be generated using the `update domain` command, please see the section on setting AuthInfo.

With this process change, the change of name servers operation using [update domain](#update-domain), also delete all DSRECORDS.

<a id="add-contact"></a>

##### add contact

The addition of a new contact to a domain name has to adhere to some policies. Do note that the change of roles only applies to registrant managed domain names, since the roles on a registrar managed domain name are implicitly the registrar managing the domain name.

1. If the contact is the admin, only the billing role can be added
2. If the authenticated user is a registrar only billing can be added
3. The new contact is requested to accept the role, so the operation is asynchronous

Adding new users require special privileges, only with the registrant, apart from the policy listed above.

<a id="remove-contact"></a>

##### remove contact

The removal of a existing contact is possible for both billing and admin contacts.

1. If the contact is the admin, both billing and admin roles can be removed
2. The admin can add a new billing role (see above)
3. If no addition the role defaults to the registrant becoming the inhabitant of the role, no request is made, the registrant is only informed of the change out of band

When a contact is removed from a given the registrant is instated in the role.

<a id="setting-authinfo"></a>

##### Setting AuthInfo

Setting the AuthInfo is done using the `update domain` command. The AuthInfo token is not set as such, but is generated using a keyword indicating the authorization scope, currently supported keywords are:

- `autoredel`
- `autotransfer`

The AuthInfo token and hence the authorization holds a lifespan of 14 days. It can be ended prematurely by unsetting it, please see below.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
  <command>
    <update>
      <domain:update xmlns:domain="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:domain-1.0">
        <domain:name>example.com</domain:name>
        <domain:chg>
          <domain:authInfo>
            <domain:pw>autoredel</domain:pw>
          </domain:authInfo>
        </domain:chg>
      </domain:update>
    </update>
    <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
  </command>
</epp>
```

The generation of an AuthInfo token can be accomplished by all users with privileges to do so.

When the authorisation has been created it is visible to the users with the privilege to generate it, not just the requester.

The token is accessible in:

- The service portal in the domain detail page
- The registrar portal in the domain detail page
- Via EPP using the [domain info](#domain-info) command

<a id="unsetting-authinfo"></a>

##### Unsetting AuthInfo

The requester (setter) of a an AuthInfo authorization might have an interest in ending the life of a AuthInfo token prematurely

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
  <command>
    <update>
      <domain:update xmlns:domain="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:domain-1.0">
        <domain:name>example.com</domain:name>
        <domain:chg>
          <domain:authInfo>
            <domain:null>
          </domain:authInfo>
        </domain:chg>
      </domain:update>
    </update>
    <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
  </command>
</epp>
```

Do note that this can be accomplished by all users with privileges to accomplish this. It adheres to [RFC:5731], which states:

> A domain:null element can be used within the domain:authInfo element to remove authorization information.

The command simply unsets (removes/clears) an AuthInfo token if it exists.

<a id="authinfo-token-format"></a>

##### AuthInfo Token Format

AuthInfo tokens are keys to delegate authorization for a single one-time operation. AuthInfo tokens are limited to work on a single object and perform a single operation, they expire after a specified time, or when used or if they are retracted.

The overall requirements are:

- Unpredictable (is secure to the extent possible and for the given TTL time frame)
- Human pronounceable (can be communicated over telephone call)
- Usable (constrained on length and format)

The **AuthInfo** token is generated upon request by DK Hostmaster and will adhere to the following proposed format:

`<role>-<operation>-<unique token>`

The AuthInfo tokens currently support the operations:

- Change of registrar via the [transfer domain](#transfer-domain) command, by using the keyword `TRANSFER`
- Change of name servers via the [update domain](#update-domain) command, , by using the keyword `REDEL`

E.g.

A transfer example: `REG-TRANSFER-098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6`

- The authorization is generated/issued by a registrar (`REG`, for registrar)
- The authorization is for a transfer operation (`TRANSFER`)
- and finally a unique key

Since an authorization could also be issue by the registrant, that example would resemble the following: `OWN-TRANSFER-098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6`

- The authorization is generated/issued by a registrant (`OWN`, for registrant/_owner_)
- The authorization is for a transfer operation (`TRANSFER`)
- and finally a unique key

An change of name servers example: `NSA-REDEL-098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6`

- The authorization is for a transfer operation (`REDEL`, for redelegation)
- The authorization is generated/issued by a registrar (`NSA`, for name server administrator)
- and finally a unique key

Since an authorization could also be issue by the registrant or proxy, those example would resemble the following:

As registrant: `OWN-REDEL-098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6`

- The authorization is generated/issued by a registrant (`OWN`, for registrant/_owner_)
- The authorization is for a transfer operation (`REDEL`)
- and finally a unique key

As proxy `PXY-REDEL-098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6`

- The authorization is generated/issued by a registrant (`PXY`, for proxy)
- The authorization is for a transfer operation (`REDEL`)
- and finally a unique key

The authorizations expires after 14 days or by use. It can be retracted via the registrar portal, the self-service portal or EPP by deletion of the authorization.

For registration of domain names offered from a waiting list, the authorization is using `AuthInfo`, the token here is however simpler and is currently formatted as a 8 character string of case insensitive hexadecimal characters.

<a href="delete-domain"></a>

#### delete domain

The default `delete domain` command behaviour is to deactivate immediately, which complies with [RFC:5731]. Not being able to complete the request will result in a error, also in compliance with [RFC:5731]. Please see below for more information on the business process for deletion.

The current expiration date can be obtained using the `info domain` command and is specified in the `domain:exDate` field. The date conforms with the required format. The [status code](status-codes), `pendingDelete` delete is set and can be removed either by the execution of the process after the redemption period or a [restore](#domain-restore) operation.

The alternative approach to deletion is to set auto expire, which will cancel the domain name subscription automatically at expiration.

Do note that it is not possible to delete a domain name on the or after the expiration date of a domain name. Domain name deletion is not prohibited on the expiration date, but due to technical constraints it is recommended to set automatic expiration instead, which will have the same result.

The deletion of a domain name results in a 30 day suspension, which is regarded as a redemption period where it is possible to restore the suspended domain name using the [restore domain](#restore-domain) command.

The status code `serverDeleteProhibited` is set:

- If the status `pendingCreate` is set, see [domain create](#domain-create)
- If the status `pendingDelete` is set
- If the domain name is on hold or blocked, meaning it has been suspended by DK Hostmaster
- If the domain name is superordinate to a name server, which has active name service
- If the domain completed ID-control unsuccessfully

<a id="delete-domain-request"></a>

##### delete domain request

The complete command will look as follows (example lifted from [RFC:5731]):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
  <epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
    <command>
      <delete>
        <domain:delete xmlns:domain="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:domain-1.0">
          <domain:name>eksempel.dk</domain:name>
          </domain:delete>
      </delete>
      <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
    </command>
  </epp>
```

<a id="delete-domain-response"></a>

##### delete domain response

And the complete command with a deletion date specification (example lifted from [RFC:5731] and modified):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
  <epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
    <command>
      <delete>
        <domain:delete xmlns:domain="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:domain-1.0">
          <domain:name>eksempel.dk</domain:name>
          </domain:delete>
      </delete>
      <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
    </command>
  </epp>
```

Domain names are not deleted immediately, but are flagged as _scheduled for deletion_. This of the `delete command` is successful, the domain name will be flagged for deletion within the timeframe specified by the business rules implemented by DK Hostmaster.

The response for a `delete domain` command will be `1001`.

Response example (example lifted from [RFC:5731] and modified):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
  <epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
    <response>
      <result code="1001">
        <msg>Command completed successfully; action pending</msg>
      </result>
      <trID>
        <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
        <svTRID>54321-XYZ</svTRID>
      </trID>
    </response>
  </epp>
```

The expiration date will be adjusted accordingly and a status `pendingDelete` with an advisory date will be applied and made available via the response to the `info domain` command, via the DK Hostmaster extension: `domainAdvisory`.

Example:

```xml
<extension>
    <dkhm:domainAdvisory advisory="pendingDeletionDate" date="2021-01-31T00:00:00.0Z" domain="eksempel.dk" xmlns:dkhm="urn:dkhm:params:xml:ns:dkhm-4.3"/>
</extension>
```

Do note that a `delete domain` command will disable auto renewal if enabled.

Do note that if subordinates exist these will block for a delete and the request will result in an error: `2305`.

<a id="restore-domain"></a>

#### restore domain

As described in [RFC:3915], with a support for grace periods, it is possible to restore a domain name scheduled for deletion, (in the state `pendingDelete`).

DK Hostmaster will support the ability to restore for two use-cases:

1. Get a domain name back to the state active from a pending deletion specified by an explicit deletion request (delete command) or a automatic expiration
1. Get a domain name back to state active from a pending deletion, caused by missing financial settlement

Domain names might be suspended for other reasons, these will no be recoverable using the described restore facility, this will be indicated using the `serverUpdateProhibited` status.

Restoration has to take place during the redemption period and will not be possible after the grace period has expired.

The restoration is requested using the update domain command.

##### restored domain request

Based on feedback from our users, we have decided to not implement the `request` operation part of the restoration process, so you have to skip directly to the `report` part of the process.

This mean we will not support the state of  `pendingRestore` for the restore process.

The step to actually complete the restoration is the `report` operation, which look as follows:

```

Example is lifted from [RFC:3915].

The proposal is to the the report part act as an acknowledgement. The domain name is restored _as-is_ if possible, so the mandatory fields:

- `rgp:preData`
- `rgp:postData`
- `rgp:resReason`
- `rgp:statement`

Have to be specified, but values are ignored. As are the optional field, which however is optional and does not have to be specified:

- `rgp:other`

The mandatory fields:

- `rgp:delTime`
- `rgp:resTime`

Have to be specified and will be evaluated according to [RFC:3915].

- The `rgp:delTime` value has to match the deletion date and time.
- The `rgp:resTime` value will be ignored since, we do not handle the `request` operation.

As described in [RFC:3915], multiple report requests can be submitted, until success and within the allowed timeframe of possible restoration.

##### XSD Definition

The `restore` command is an extension to `update domain`. All is described in [RFC:3915]. The XSD has been included in our EPP XSD repository as `rgs-1.0.xsd` all lifted from [RFC:3915], please see [the repository][DKHMXSD] for details.

<a id="transfer-domain"></a>

#### transfer domain

The transfer command is only available to registrars. The command should used in the following use-cases.

- Transfer from DK Hostmaster to a future registrar
- Transfer from the current registrar to a future registrar

The implementation is based on a _pull_ model and both operations require authorization via the use of an AuthInfo token and designated domain name. The operation has to be initiated by the future registrar. who has acquired the authorization (AuthInfo token) from the current registrar or the registrant.

The transfer from DK Hostmaster to a new registrar implies a change of administrative model from "registrant management" to "registrar management". Whereas the transfer from registrar to registrar is only a change of administrative party not the administrative model.

The registrar always have the option to withdraw from the role of registrar for a given domain name, this change does not require an authorization. The operation is implemented using the [withdraw](#withdraw-domain) command, described below in details. This command set the registrar to be the registry (DK Hostmaster) and the administrative model changes from "registrar management" to "registrant management".

Also the registrant has the option to exchange the current registrar. This operation implies a change of administrative model from "registrar management" to "registrant management" and is limited to change of model. A change of registrar, requires authorization of a third party by the registrant and that the designated registrar executes the operation of taking the role of administrator as described initially in this section.

The administration of authorizations is described in detail under the [update-domain](#update-domain) command.

- [Setting AuthInfo](#setting-authinfo)
- [Unsetting AuthInfo](#unsetting-authinfo)

Do also see the general description of the [AuthInfo](#authinfo) implementation.

The transfer process differs from the one outlined in the [RFC:5731], the following status codes should only be the ones observed:

- `serverApproved`

The following should not be observed (ref: `domain:trStatus`), since the process does not implement the same transactional model:

- `clientApproved`
- `clientCancelled`
- `clientRejected`
- `pending`
- `serverCancelled`

Upon transfer, the contact object referring to the registrant role, is being cloned to avoid issues with _disappearing data_ and _sponsorship_ in cross-portfolio operations. Do note that DK Hostmaster does not implement direct transfer of contact objects as described in the "Implementation Limitations" section.

A contact object (registrant) is cloned without additional relations bound to other objects within the registry or another portfolio, only the key object, the domain name is transferred, together with potential subordinate objects such as name servers.

The cloning is a _best-effort_ cloning, since the ID-control status cannot be guaranteed to be consistent in the case where a contact object is locked to a register, but has limitations in access to data due to policies in regard to disclosure etc.

The clone might be deleted if these relations are terminated or removed, please see the description of the contact object deletion policy described in the section on the [delete contact command](#delete-contact) for details.

The status code `serverTransferProhibited` is set:

- If the status `pendingCreate` is set, see [domain create](#domain-create)
- If the domain name is not settled/paid
- If the domain name is registrant managed and has VID service
- If the registrant has an active or declined ID-control request
- If the domain name is on hold or blocked, meaning it has been suspended by DK Hostmaster

<a id="transition-period"></a>

#### Transition Period

The transition period is a special period following the introduction of the transfer command with version 4.0.0 of the EPP service.

During the transition period, registrars can do a transfer without providing the else mandatory AuthInfo token with the [transfer domain](#transfer-domain) command.

The following prerequisites has to be in place for this operation to be possible:

- The designated domain name has to be linked to a name server belonging to the requesting registrar
- This ownership is identified as the name server administrator for the specific name server is linked to the registrar group of the requesting registrar
- The transfer has to be completed by a user with the registrar role, which can be appointed in the registrar portal
- The registrar will have to have collected a consent from the registrant of the designated domain name

The moment a transfer from registrant management is completed, it is no longer viable for this transfer, even if the name servers are administered by others that the registrar

If a domain name is transferred back to the registry, it will become eligible for the transfer again, of course the mentioned conditions will have to be met and the consent will have to be collected again.

<a id="withdraw"></a>

#### Withdraw

DK Hostmaster support the option for registrars of transferring out, so where the regular transfer command (described above) is a _pull_ operation. The registrar can _push_ a domain name from it's portfolio to DK Hostmaster, when and if a registrar requires so.

The process resembles the transfer, but with the receiving account being DK Hostmaster.

The implementation is based on the extension developed by Norid, the registry for the ccTLD for Norway (.no). The specification is listed in the references section below.

Since this extension is at a higher level than the other extensions defined by DK Hostmaster. The definition look as follows:

<a id="contact"></a>

### Contact

The default behavior of the EPP `create contact` command as described in [RFC:5733], will attach the client-ID (`CLID`) of the authenticated party to the object created, just as for the domain creation described above.

The contact object will be under the sponsoring party throughout it's _life-cycle_ and transfer of contact objects will not be explicitly supported, see [Unimplemented commands](#unimplemented-commands) section.

As for the `create domain` command (above) the default behaviour can be defined in RP. Where the option "registrant management", will create contact objects sponsored by DK Hostmaster instead instead of the registrar.

Deletion will not be supported and will work as it currently is implemented in the DK Hostmaster EPP service and described in the specification. See the section: [Unimplemented commands](#unimplemented-commands) for details. Contact objects are automatically deleted, under the following policy:

- The contact object is not in use
- It holds not roles/association with other objects
- The associated financial account holds a balance of 0
- It has been inactive for 45 days

The maintenance, meaning changes and updates to data, will also be limited. DK Hostmaster locks contact objects for changes if these have been matched to a register for name and address information, this applies to:

- Danish citizens of the type individual, bound to the CPR register
- Danish companies, public organizations and associations of the types, bound to the CVR register

The following contact types are also limited, due to the VAT number validation:

- EU companies, public organizations and associations of the types, bound to the EU Vies register

All other types has to be maintained by the sponsoring client, with the exception of the name attribute.

A contact object consist of the following data.

| Data            | Can be locked      | Note                                                                                                                            |

The locking of data is towards an authoritative register, like CPR (Central Person Register, Danish individuals) or CVR (Dansk Virksomheds Register, Danish companies, associations and public organisations).

Locking is applied in conjunction with

- Successful ID-control
- For Danish companies, associations and public organisations if a CVR number is matched towards the CVR register
- For European companies, associations and public organisations if a VAT number is matched towards the VIES service
- For contact object appointed as registrants and waiting list position owners, the name is locked in order to prevent change of ownership of these

<a id="create-contact"></a>

#### create contact

This part of the EPP protocol is described in [RFC:5733].

This command has been extended with the following fields:

- `dkhm:usertype`, which has to be one of:
	- `company`, indicating a company
	- `public_organization`, indicating a public organization
	- `association`, indicating an association
	- `individual`, indicating an individual

The user type will result in context-specific interpretation of the following fields:

- EAN - this number is only supported for user types: `company`, `public_organization` and `association`. It is only mandatory for `public_organization` and optional for `company` and `association`. [EAN][EAN] is used by the public sector in Denmark for electronic invoicing, private companies can also be assigned [EAN], but this it not so widespread at this time. EAN is required by law for public sector organizations, so this field has to be completed and it has to validate for this type.
- CVR - (VAT number) this is only supported for user types: `company`, `public_organization` and `association`. The number is **required** for handling VAT correctly, The rules for indication of the field is specified in the table below.
- p-number - (production unit number) this is only supported for user types: `company`, `public_organization` and `association`. The number is used for handling validation correctly and it relates to the CVR (Vat number field) the field is optional.

This field is validated on the server side, it is however recommended to perform a [check contact](#check-contact) on the requested contact-id prior to the [create domain](#create-domain) request if a contact-id is already known from a contact create or previous domain creation/application.

The `contact-id` field is auto-generated and assigned by DK Hostmaster. EPP do however open for providing a contact-id in the context of the create contact command, this is not supported by DK Hostmaster at this point, see also: [Implementation Limitations](#implementation-limitations).

The choice of administration model is based on the default set for the registrar account, this influences domain application and contact creation and this can be set in the registrar portal. It can be overwritten per request using the `dkhm:management` extension, which can have one of two values:

- `registrar`, indicating registrar management
- `registrant`, indicating registrant management

<a id="forced-and-smart-contact-creation"></a>

##### Forced and Smart Contact Creation

For contact creation DK Hostmaster supports two ways:

1. Smart creation, where the data provided is used to inquire if an existing user with the same data is present. If no user is found a new contact is created. This is accomplished using the keyword: `auto`
2. Forced creation, where a new contact is created. This is accomplished using the keyword: `force`

Specification of a user-id / handle for the contact creation is not supported. The user-id / handle is auto-generated and assigned by DK Hostmaster.

For _smart_ creation:

```XML
<contact:id>auto</contact:id>
```

For _forced_ creation:

```XML
<contact:id>force</contact:id>
```

Please note that the `auto` and `force` keywords are in lower-case.

The match for the _smart_ creation are applicable for the following data:

- `<dkhm:userType>`
- `<dkhm:CVR>`
- `<contact:name>`
- `<contact:street>`
- `<contact:email>`
- `<contact:pc>`
- `<contact:cc>`

The match has to be exact in order for the command to return an existing user-id / handle.

Since created users might be selected for ID-control and ID-control can alter the data an `[contact info](#info-contact)`, can be useful to validate customer data. Prior to attempted match.

<a id="address-handling"></a>

##### Address Handling

Contact creation under EPP opens for the ability to represent postal information in both local and international representations. Due to the representation in DK Hostmaster's system for handling contacts the following rules are applied to postal information.

For Denmark the local representation is chosen and the international representation is discarded. For other countries the international representation is chosen and the local representation is discarded. Please see the table below.

| Denmark                      | Other country                    |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Local representation**     | Local representation             |
| International representation | **International representation** |

This is a diagram depicting the general algorithm used for resolving the address data. The algorithm presupposes that at least one address is present.

Diagram of address resolution for contact creation [:eye_speech_bubble:][epp-address-resolution]

It is important to note that if the international representation is specified, but data are provided in local representation or only local representation is provided for an international address, communication to the specified address might prove unreliable.

The handling of name and organization is also a special case. Where the following mapping is made based on the user type.

<table>
<tr>
		<th></th><th colspan="2">Name and Organization Provided</th><th>Only name provided</th>
<tr>
		<th>User type</th><th>Name (<i>mandatory</i>)</th><th>organization (<i>optional</i>)</th><th>Name (<i>mandatory</i>)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
		<td>C (Company)</td><td>attention</td><td>name</td><td>name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
		<td>P (Public organization)</td><td>attention</td><td>name</td><td>name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
		<td>A (Association)</td><td>attention</td><td>name</td><td>name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
		<td>I (Individual)</td><td>name</td><td>-</td><td>name</td>
</tr>
</table>

The data is collected as required by Danish legislation. See also the data collection policy section below.

Please note:

- `authInfo` section is ignored is not recommended for transport of end-user passwords, see also [AuthInfo](#authinfo).
- Contact creation is silent and the designated contact object is not notified about the the creation, unless this is a part of the process of associating the user with other objects

<a id="transfer-contact"></a>

#### transfer contact

Transfer of contacts is not supported in the .dk registry.

When a [transfer domain](#transfer-domain) or [withdraw](#withdraw) operation is done. The contact object appointed to the registrar role is cloned and the clone is allocated to the new portfolio and the original contact object is left intact in the original portfolio.

<a id="host"></a>

### Host

The default behavior of the EPP `create host` command as described in [RFC:5732], will attach the client-ID (`CLID`) of the authenticated party to the created host object.

The `create host` command will be limited in that sense that it will not be possible to create a host object, which is subordinate to a domain name (superordinate), which is sponsored by another registrar.

This mean that the association with the registrar is based on the administrative model.

This limitation will only be enforced for domain names under the `.dk` TLD. Domain names under other TLDs will not be subject to this limitation.

As for the `create domain` and `create contact` commands (above) the default behaviour can be defined in RP. Where the option "registrant management", will create host objects sponsored by DK Hostmaster instead of the registrar.

Responsibility and privileges for maintenance (`update host`) of the host object is assigned to the name server administrator as described in the [create host section](#create-host) section.

If the name server responsible is allocated to the registrar account (group), this can be handled via RP and EPP.

The deletion of host objects are under a similar regime, as specified in the [delete host](#delete-host) section.

<a id="create-host"></a>

#### create host

This part of the EPP protocol is described in [RFC:5732]. This command adheres to the standard. The command can be extended to specify another name server administrator than the authenticated user.

:point_right: Please note that IP addresses are required for domain names ending in '.dk', please refer to the [glue record policy][DKHMDNSSPECGLUE].

:warning: By default the authenticated user is attempted used as designated name server administrator, It is however not possible to assign a registrar account as name server administrator, so a regular WHOIS handle pointing to a contact object has to be specified using the extension `dkhm:requestedNsAdmin`, alternatively you can authenticate using a WHOIS handle and the use of the extension can be avoided.

Diagram of EPP create host [:eye_speech_bubble:][epp_create_host]

The command can be used in two scenarios:

### info host

This part of the EPP protocol is described in [RFC:5732]. This command adheres to the standard.

Please note that according to the RFC [section 3.1.2][RFC:5732-3.1.2], the `CLID` points to the sponsoring client.

This field supports the two administrative models as follows:

- For registrar managed host object, the `CLID` points to the registrar, see also [Disclosure of Client ID](#disclosure-of-client-id)
- For registrar managed host objects, DK Hostmaster interprets this as the technical contact for the name server identified by the host object

This part of the EPP protocol is described in [RFC:5732]. This command adheres to the standard, but is extended to service one special usage scenario.

<a id="process"></a>

##### process

This is the overall process, the process is divided into sub-processes, please see the processes below for details.

Diagram of EPP update host [:eye_speech_bubble:][epp_update_host]

<a id="change-hostname-sub-process"></a>

##### Change hostname sub-process

The process of changing a host name is unsupported by DK Hostmaster and will always result in an error code: `2102`.

##### Change admin sub-process

Diagram of EPP update host change admin [:eye_speech_bubble:][epp_update_host_change_admin]

The command can be used in two scenarios:

1. The command is used as described in the RFC and IP addresses can be administered
2. The command is extended with a contact object pointing to an existing user, which is requested to takeover the role as name server administrator for the host object requested updated

The update of a host object can only be requested by the administrator of the given host.

| Return Code | Description                                                                                              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| 2102        | The command contains status elements                                                                     |
| 2201        | If the authenticated user does not hold the privilege to update the specified host object                |
| 2303        | If the specified host object does not exist                                                              |
| 2303        | If the contact-id pointed to in `dkhm:requestedNsAdmin` points to a non-existing contact object          |
| 2304        | The number of IP addresses are below the required limit                                                  |

As for update host `1001` holds higher precedence than `1000`, so if any of the sub-commands require additional review and are _pending_, the return code will be `1001`.

As described in Implementation Limitations, the service does not support setting of status via update host.

#### Host Status Codes

This list of EPP host status codes is based on information from [RFC:5732].

The description is the status, use and interpretation by DK Hostmaster.

As a general business rule, DK Hostmaster does not support the `client*` statuses, see also: [Unsupported Host Status Codes](#unsupported-host-status-codes) in the [Implementation Limitations](#implementation-limitations) section.
